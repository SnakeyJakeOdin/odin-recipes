    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Coffee, a beloved beverage enjoyed worldwide, has a rich history that can be traced back to its Latin American origins. Legend has it that it was discovered in Ethiopia and eventually made its way to Latin America through colonization and trade. Countries like Brazil, Colombia, and Guatemala have become renowned for their coffee production. Today, coffee is not just a drink; it is a social experience that can be enjoyed by everyone, regardless of their preferences or location. Coffee brings people together and delights our senses with its aroma and invigorating taste.
